# 🌍 Earthquake Velocity ROM Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository focuses on reducing and learning the dynamics of velocity fields generated by earthquake simulations. These simulations solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and produce time series data representing vibrations at different "quake velocities".

We apply **Reduced Order Modeling (ROM)** via **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to extract compact representations (coefficients and basis functions) of these high-dimensional simulations. Then, we use **machine learning techniques** to learn the relationship between **quake velocities** and their corresponding **time series of ROM coefficients**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

- Earthquake simulation data gives velocity fields as time-series, across different quake velocities.
- Each time step's data is high-dimensional. To manage this, we use **SVD-based ROM** to:
  - Extract velocity-independent **basis functions**.
  - Encode each simulation into a **small set of time-series coefficients**.
- These coefficients vary with quake velocity and represent the reduced dynamics.

## 🎯 Objective

Learn a model `f(velocity) → coefficient time series`  
This will allow us to:
- Predict simulation dynamics for unseen velocities.
- Dramatically reduce the need to rerun simulations.

## 📊 Data Overview

- `.txt` file containing flattened simulation data reshaped into `(timesteps, spatial_points, velocity_components)`.
- `velocity_values`: array of quake velocities.
- After ROM: `coefficients` of shape `(timesteps, num_modes)`, one set per velocity.
